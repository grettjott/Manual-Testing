# Manual-testing

My projects and work related to manual testing, showcasing my skills and knowledge as a Junior QA Tester.

Manual Web Application Testing for E-shop Platforms: Practical workshops to perform manual testing using test cases, exploratory testing, and bug reporting tools.

Performing hands-on manual testing on e-shop platforms by executing test cases to ensure the web application functions as expected. Simulating real user behavior without the use of automation tools to identify bugs, usability issues, and inconsistencies, specifically focusing on e-commerce features like login, product search, checkout processes and others. Learning to document test results, report bugs using tools like JIRA or GitHub Issues. Focusing on both functional testing and user experience, while also testing across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility, performance, and smooth customer interactions.
